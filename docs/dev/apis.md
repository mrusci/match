# APIs

On the MATCH framework there are a set of APIs that are used during the code generation phase to obtain a functional program, these functions can be reimplemented by the user, who should adhere to the original prototypes, and inform MATCH of the name of these APIs.

In almost all APIs a pointer to a `MatchCtx` structure is passed, this is to give more freedom to the user, since this structure contains informations about the current pattern.
